# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a sleek, Apple-inspired AI video editor web application. The system will provide an intuitive, minimalist interface for video editing with AI-powered features, built using Remix.js for the frontend and Python/FastAPI for the backend. The design will follow Apple's design philosophy and draw inspiration from Awwwards-winning websites, while adhering to the HEART framework for user-centric development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a video creator, I want a clean and intuitive interface that allows me to easily navigate and use video editing tools, so that I can focus on creating content without being overwhelmed by complex UI elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a minimalist interface with a dark theme (bg-gray-900) and clean typography
2. WHEN a user hovers over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide subtle visual feedback with smooth transitions
3. WHEN the interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL use a three-panel layout with media library/inspector (left), preview/timeline (center), and maintain consistent spacing and borders
4. IF the user interacts with any UI element THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms with appropriate visual feedback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a video editor, I want to easily import and organize my media files, so that I can quickly access and use them in my video projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags files over the upload zone THEN the system SHALL highlight the drop area with visual feedback (border-blue-400)
2. WHEN files are dropped or selected THEN the system SHALL accept video, audio, and image formats and display them as thumbnails
3. WHEN media thumbnails are displayed THEN the system SHALL show file names and provide hover overlays with action buttons
4. WHEN a user clicks on a media thumbnail THEN the system SHALL allow adding the media to the timeline
5. IF the upload fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with retry options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a video editor, I want a responsive timeline interface where I can arrange, trim, and edit video clips, so that I can create my desired video sequence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the timeline is displayed THEN the system SHALL show multiple tracks (video, audio, captions) with clear visual separation
2. WHEN a user drags a clip from the media library THEN the system SHALL allow dropping it onto any appropriate track
3. WHEN clips are placed on the timeline THEN the system SHALL provide magnetic snapping to other clips and the playhead
4. WHEN a user selects a clip THEN the system SHALL highlight it and show trim handles on the edges
5. WHEN trim handles are dragged THEN the system SHALL update the clip duration in real-time
6. WHEN the playhead is moved THEN the system SHALL update the preview player to show the corresponding frame

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a video editor, I want a context-aware inspector panel that shows properties of selected elements, so that I can make precise adjustments to my video content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no element is selected THEN the inspector SHALL display "Select a clip to inspect its properties"
2. WHEN a video clip is selected THEN the inspector SHALL show relevant properties (Transform, Filters, Audio sections)
3. WHEN property values are changed THEN the system SHALL update the preview in real-time
4. WHEN switching between selected elements THEN the inspector SHALL smoothly transition between different property sets
5. IF invalid values are entered THEN the system SHALL validate and provide feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a video creator, I want AI-powered automatic captioning for my videos, so that I can make my content more accessible without manual transcription work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video or audio clip is selected THEN the inspector SHALL display a "Generate Captions" button
2. WHEN the "Generate Captions" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL show loading state and disable the button
3. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL create caption clips on a dedicated captions track
4. WHEN caption clips are created THEN each clip SHALL be positioned according to its timestamp and contain the transcribed text
5. IF transcription fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and restore the button to its original state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a video editor, I want to preview my video in real-time as I make edits, so that I can see the immediate results of my changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the preview player loads THEN the system SHALL display the current frame at the playhead position
2. WHEN timeline changes are made THEN the preview SHALL update in real-time without requiring manual refresh
3. WHEN the play button is pressed THEN the system SHALL provide smooth, high-quality video playback
4. WHEN scrubbing through the timeline THEN the system SHALL allow frame-by-frame navigation
5. IF video processing is required THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators during processing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a video creator, I want to export my finished video in various formats, so that I can share it on different platforms or save it for different purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the "Export" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL display export options (format, quality, resolution)
2. WHEN export settings are confirmed THEN the system SHALL process the video and show progress indication
3. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL provide download link or save confirmation
4. WHEN export is in progress THEN the system SHALL allow cancellation of the export process
5. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL display error details and suggest solutions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure authentication and project management, so that my video projects and media are safely stored and accessible across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL require secure authentication
2. WHEN authenticated THEN the system SHALL load the user's saved projects and media library
3. WHEN changes are made to a project THEN the system SHALL auto-save progress periodically
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL securely clear session data
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
